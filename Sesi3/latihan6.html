            Our comprehensive guide to CSS flexbox layout. This complete guide explains everything about
            flexbox, focusing on all the different possible properties for the parent element (the flex container) and
            the child elements (the flex items). It also includes history, demos, patterns, and a browser support chart.

            This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value
            that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the
            item should take up.

            If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to
            all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, that child would take up twice as much of the space
            either one of the others (or it will try, at least).
